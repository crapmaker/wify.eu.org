<p>Every Sunday morning I take a light jog around a park near my home. There’s a lake
    located in one corner of the park. Each time I jog by this lake, I see the same elderly woman sitting at the water’s
    edge with a small metal cage sitting beside her. </p>
<p>This past Sunday my curiosity got the best of me, so I stopped jogging
    and walked over to her. As I got closer, I realized that the metal cage was in fact a small trap. There were three
    turtles, unharmed, slowly walking around the base of the trap. </p>
<p>She had a fourth turtle in her lap that she was carefully scrubbing with a spongy brush. “Hello,” I said. “I see you here every Sunday morning. If you don’t mind my
    nosiness, I’d love to know what you’re doing with these turtles.”</p>
<p>She smiled. “I’m cleaning off their shells,” she replied. “Anything on a turtle’s shell, like algae or scum, reduces
    the turtle’s ability to absorb heat and impedes its ability to swim. It can also corrode and weaken the shell over
    time.” “Wow! That’s really nice of you!” I exclaimed.</p>
<p>She went on: “I spend a couple of hours each Sunday morning, relaxing by this lake and helping these little guys out.
    It’s my own strange way of making a difference.”“But don’t most freshwater turtles live their whole lives with algae 
    and scum hanging from their shells?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yep, sadly, they do,” she replied. I scratched my head. “Well then, don’t you think your time could be better spent? I
    mean, I think your efforts are kind and all, but there are fresh water turtles living in lakes all around the world.
    And 99% of these turtles don’t have kind people like you to help them clean off their shells. So, no offense… but how
    exactly are your localized efforts here truly making a difference?” The woman giggled aloud. </p>
<p>She then looked down at the turtle in her lap, scrubbed off the last piece of algae from its shell, and said, “Sweetie, if this little guy
    could talk, he’d tell you I just made all the difference in the world.” The moral: You can change the world – maybe not
    all at once, but one person, one animal, and one good deed at a time. Wake up every morning and pretend like what you
    do makes a difference. It does.</p>`
