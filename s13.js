<p>One warm evening many years ago…</p>
<p>After spending nearly every waking minute with Angel for eight straight days, I knew that I had to tell her just one
        thing. So late at night, just before she fell asleep, I whispered it in her ear. </p>
<p>She smiled – the kind of smile that makes me smile back –and she said, “When I’m seventy-five and I think about my life and what it was like to 
        be young, I hope that I can remember this very moment.” A few seconds later she closed her eyes and fell asleep. The room was
        peaceful – almost silent. All I could hear was the soft purr of her breathing. </p>
<p>I stayed awake thinking about the time
        we’d spent together and all the choices in our lives that made this moment possible. And at some point, I realized that
        it didn’t matter what we’d done or where we’d gone. Nor did the future hold any significance. </p>
<p>All that mattered was the
        serenity of the moment.
        Just being with her and breathing with her.</p>`
