<br />
<p>There was a blind girl who hated herself purely for the fact she was blind. The only person she didn’t hate was her
    loving boyfriend, as he was always there for her. She said that if she could only see the world, she would marry him.</p>
<p>One day, someone donated a pair of eyes to her – now she could see everything, including her boyfriend. Her boyfriend
    asked her, “now that you can see the world, will you marry me?” </p>
<p>The girl was shocked when she saw that her boyfriendwas blind too, and refused to marry him. Her boyfriend walked away 
    in tears, and later wrote a letter to her saying:
    “Just take care of my eyes dear.”</p>
<p>Moral of the story: When our circumstances change, so does our mind. Some people may not be able to see the way things
    were before, and might not be able to appreciate them. There are many things to take away from this story, not just
    one.</p>
<p>This is one of the inspirational short stories that left me speechless.</p>`
