<p>Value A popular speaker started off a seminar by holding up a $20 bill. A crowd of 200 had gathered to hear him speak.
    He asked, “Who would like this $20 bill?”</p>
<p>200 hands went up. He said, “I am going to give this $20 to one of you but first, let me do this.” He crumpled the bill
    up.He then asked, “Who still wants it?”</p>
<p>All 200 hands were still raised. “Well,” he replied, “What if I do this?” Then he dropped the bill on the ground and
    stomped on it with his shoes.</p>
<p>He picked it up, and showed it to the crowd. The bill was all crumpled and dirty.
    “Now who still wants it?” All the hands still went up.</p>
<p>“My friends, I have just showed you a very important lesson. No matter what I did to the money, you still wanted it
    because it did not decrease in value. It was still worth $20. Many times in our lives, life crumples us and grinds us
    into the dirt.</p>
<p>We make bad decisions or deal with poor circumstances. We feel worthless. But no matter what has
    happened or what will happen, you will never lose your value. You are special – Don’t ever forget it!</p>`
