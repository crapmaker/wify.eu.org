<p>The Weight of the Glass Once upon a time a psychology professor walked around on a stage while teaching stress
    management principles to an auditorium filled with students. As she raised a glass of water, everyone expected they’d
    be asked the typical “glass half empty or glass half full” question.</p>
<p>Instead, with a smile on her face, the professor
    asked, “How heavy is this glass of water I’m holding?” Students shouted out answers ranging from eight ounces to a
    couple pounds.</p>
<p>She replied, “From my perspective, the absolute weight of this glass doesn’t matter. It all depends on how long I hold
    it. If I hold it for a minute or two, it’s fairly light. If I hold it for an hour straight, its weight might make my
    arm ache a little.</p>
<p>If I hold it for a day straight, my arm will likely cramp up and feel completely numb and paralyzed,
    forcing me to drop the glass to the floor. In each case, the weight of the glass doesn’t change, but the longer I hold
    it, the heavier it feels to me.” As the class shook their heads in agreement. </p>
<p>she continued, “Your stresses and worries
    in life are very much like this glass of water. Think about them for a while and nothing happens. Think about them a
    bit longer and you begin to ache a little. Think about them all day long, and you will feel completely numb and
    paralyzed – incapable of doing anything else until you drop them.”</p>`
